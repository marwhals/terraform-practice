## Motivations for Terraform

### Traditional Practices

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Business] --> B[Business Analyst] --> C[Solution Architect] --> D[Procurement Team]
    D --> Z

    subgraph J[Infrastructure team]
        direction LR
        Z[Field Engineers]
        Y[System/ NW Administrators]
        X[Storage Admins]

    end

        direction LR
    end

```

### Problems with this model
1) Slow Deployment
2) Expensive
3) Limited Automation
4) Human Error
5) Wasted Resources (Hard to scale up and down)

## Infrastructure as Code tools (IaC)

*Can be roughly split into three categories*

### Server Templating
- Docker
- Packer
- Vagrant
### Provisioning Tools
- Terraform
- CloudFormation
### Configuration Management
- Anisble
- SaltStack
- Puppet

### Configuration Management
- Designed to Install and Manage Software
- Maintains Standard Structure
- Version Control
- Idempotent

### Server Templating Tools
- Pre Installed Software and Dependencies
- Virtual Machine of Docker Images
- Immutable Infrastructure

### Provisioning Tools
- Deploy Immutable Infrastructure resources
- Servers, Databases, Network Components etc.
- Multiple Providers

# Why Terraform

- Deploy infrastructure across different platforms
- How?
  - Achieved through providers managing providers through their APIs 

## HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
- All configuration files are defined it .tf files
- Code is declarative
  - I.e the code is that state that we want our infrastructure to be in.
  - Terraform will figure out how to go from current state to desired state
- Terraform works in three phases
  - Init - Terraform initialises the project
  - Plan - Terraform drafts a plan to get to the target state
  - Apply - Terraform makes the necessary changes required on the target environment to bring it to the desired state
    - If for some reason the environment was to shift from the desired state, then a subsequent Terraform apply will bring it back to the desired state
- Every object that Terraform manages is called a resource
  - A resource can be a compute instance, a cloud database server or a physical on premise server that Terraform manages
  - Terraform manages the lifecycle of the resources from its provisioning to configuration and decommissioning
  - Terraform records the state of the infrastructure as it is seen in the real world and based on this, it can determine what actions to take when updating resources for a particular platform.
    - Terraform can ensure that the entire infrastructure is always in the defined state at all times.
    - The state is a blueprint of the infrastructure deployed by Terraform
    - Terraform can read attributes of existing infrastructure components by configuring data sources
      - This can later be used for configuring other resources within Terraform
      - Terraform can also import other resources outside of Terraform that were created manually or by the means of other IaC tools and bring it under its control so that it can manage those resources going forward.

# Terminology
- What is a **resource**?
  - A resource is an object which terraform manages. *This could be a lot of things*

# HCL syntax
- Consists of blocks and arguments

```hcl

<block> <parameters> {
  key1 = value1
  key2 = value2
}


```

A block in terraform contains information about the infrastructure plaform and a set of resources within that platform that we want to create.

```hcl

resource "local_file" "pet" {
  filename = "/root/pets.txt"
  content = "We love pets!"
}

###### Cloud based example

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
  ami = "ami-234234987"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

# 1. Create an S3 bucket (if you donâ€™t already have one)
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "pets_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-pets-bucket-123456" # Must be globally unique
  force_destroy = true

  tags = {
    Name = "PetsBucket"
  }
}

# 2. Upload the "We love pets!" content as a file
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "pet" {
  bucket  = aws_s3_bucket.pets_bucket.id
  key     = "pets.txt"
  content = "We love pets!"
  acl     = "private"

  tags = {
    Purpose = "Pet Declaration"
  }
}

```

*Each resource type has specific arguments that they would expect*

# Creating the resources
- `terraform init`
  - This will check the working directory containing the .tf file
- `terraform plan`
  - This command wil show that actions that will be carried out by Terraform to create the resource
- `teraform apply`
  - This will create the resource
    - This command will display the execution plan again
    - Ask for user confirmation
    - Once confirmed it will create the resources
- `terraform show`
  - Use this command to see the details of the resource that was just created

*terraform documentation is very comprehensive*

# Updating and Destroying Infrastructure
- `terraform destroy`
